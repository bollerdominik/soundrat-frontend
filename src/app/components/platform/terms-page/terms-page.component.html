Each such purchase is a &ldquo;Transaction,&rdquo; each Transaction involving Digital Content is a &ldquo;Digital Transaction,&rdquo;. Company does not store any credit card information. All payments are subject to Stripe terms and condition and fees outlined at </span><span

The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Content you purchase in a Transaction cannot be guaranteed to be available to you perpetually. For example, if we receive a notification of claimed infringement from a copyright owner or its agent with respect to specific Content, then U.S. law may require us to remove that Content from the Service and not make it available for future sale and we may also have to deny continued access to anyone who previously purchased such Content. This means that you may lose access to purchased Content previously available to you through the Service.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">If we are required by law to deny access through the Service to previously purchased Content, including by removing access to Content from a user&rsquo;s personal collection through any mobile application, then Company and Artists will not provide the user who purchased that Content with a refund, except as required by applicable law. Users bear all risk from the denial of access to any Content purchased through the Service.</span>
